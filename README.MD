A comprehensive collection of C# extension methods for Unity, designed to streamline your development process, reduce boilerplate code, and make your scripts more readable and efficient.

## Why Use Unity Extensions?

This package is a valuable toolkit for any Unity developer. Hereâ€™s why you should consider adding it to your project:

*   **Write Cleaner Code:** Replace verbose, repetitive code with concise and expressive method calls.
*   **Save Time:** Stop reinventing the wheel. This library provides a wide range of pre-built, tested utility functions for common tasks.
*   **Improve Readability:** Extension methods allow you to write code that is more fluent and easier to understand at a glance.
*   **Extensive Functionality:** From `Transform` and `GameObject` manipulations to `string` and `color` utilities, this package has you covered.

## Key Features

Here is a glimpse of the extension categories available in this package.

### `Transform` Extensions

Manipulate `Transform` components with ease. Set positions, rotations, and scales on individual axes, manage child objects, and more.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Before
Vector3 pos = transform.position;
pos.x = 5f;
transform.position = pos;

// After
transform.SetX(5f);

// Destroy all children of a transform
transform.DestroyChildren();
```

### `GameObject` Extensions

Simplify common `GameObject`-related tasks like adding components and managing object hierarchies.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Before
MyComponent component = gameObject.GetComponent<MyComponent>();
if (component == null)
{
    component = gameObject.AddComponent<MyComponent>();
}

// After
MyComponent component = gameObject.GetOrAddComponent<MyComponent>();
```

### `String` Extensions

A set of powerful extensions for string manipulation, including formatting, case conversion, and complex parsing.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Convert a string to Title Case
string title = "hello world".TitleCase(); // "Hello World"

// Extract initials from a name
string initials = "John F. Kennedy".ExtractInitialsFromName(); // "JK"
```

### `Color` Extensions

Work with colors more intuitively.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Create a new color with a modified alpha value
Color myColor = Color.red;
Color transparentRed = myColor.WithAlpha(0.5f);
```

### And Many More...

This package includes a wide variety of other extensions for:
*   `Camera`
*   `Enums`
*   `Enumerables`
*   `Vectors`
*   `RectTransform`
*   `Numbers` (float, int)
*   And more!

## How to Use

Once the package is installed, the extension methods will be available automatically on the relevant types. Simply add the `using GG.Extensions;` namespace to your C# scripts to start using them.

**Example Script:**

using UnityEngine;
using GG.Extensions; // Don't forget this using statement!

public class MyPlayer : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Example using a Transform extension
        transform.SetLocalX(0f);

        // Example using a GameObject extension
        var rb = gameObject.GetOrAddComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }
}
```
